      <p>The first covid-19 case has been detected was in the state of Victoria</p>
      <p>The reason for slower spreading speed is because Australia did not have much community transmission and they still shut their borders and implemented social distancing polices, shutting down bars and pubs</p>
      <p>The government’s own caution was highlighted by a deal to boost public health system with and extea 34000 hospital beds, along with thousands of doctors and nurses. Australia will also take delivery of more than 5,000 ventilators at the end of April</p>
      <p>Health officials said earlier they wanted to increase testing, especially in places of COVID-19 clusters like Sydney’s Bondi area, which drew attention after people ignored social distancing rules and flocked to the beach. State officials said the virus may have been transmitted in the Bondi community via a backpacker unaware of having the disease.</p>
      <p>Six baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive for the virus, adding that other employees who had come into contact with the infected staff would self-isolate.</p>
     <h3>So please if you are an American citizen:</h3>
   <blockquote>
     <ul>
  <li>clean and disinfect objects you use often such as mobile phones, keys, wallets and work passes</li>
  <li>Stay at home as much as possible</li>
  <li>if going out is necessary wear a medical mask</li>
  <li>Avoid being in dense places in cities as they are known for widespread of the virus</li>
    </ul>
