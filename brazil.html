      <p>To late May of 2020, Brazil was confirmed to occupy the second highest place in the number of cases of COVID-19 surpassed only by the United States. The virus started in Brazil when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus. São Paulo is known to be the densest city In Brazil leading to a contribution for the contagion to take place at higher rates and there weren’t enough places in hospitals.</p>
      <p>Also, there was a defect in the healthcare system that had a role in spread of the virus. Salvador and employees at four hospitals of São Paulo declared lack of healthcare materials like masks, gloves and hand sanitizers because of the rise in prizes that they need to use while being subjected to suspected COVID-19 cases. Also, stores specializing in storing medical healthcare equipment no longer had masks or gloves, including N95 masks used by health professionals. It was reported that street vendors took profit from the lack of these masks.</p>
      <p>Some religious people stood against the closure of churches and that the daily services of these churches shouldn’t be suspended.</p>
      <p>Also lack of clean water for washing helps in spreading the virus which was shown during the lack of water for residents of Favelas in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>It has become more obvious to spot hotspots of the proliferation of the virus when it comes to shortage of healthcare equipment such as masks and hand sanitizers, lack of clean water, and over population.</p>
     <h3>So please if you are a Brazilian citizen:</h3>
   <blockquote>
     <ul>
  <li>Stay at home as much as possible</li>
  <li>Use healthcare equipment wisely, safety of your country is worth these wasted materials.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you have enough water for cleaning</li>
  <li>Avoid being in dense places in cities as they are known for widespread of the virus</li>
    </ul>
