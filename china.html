      <p>The first case of Covid-19 appeared in Wuhan, China and began to spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing</p>
      <p>The virus is likely an animal infection. The disease is transmitted from animals to humans and therefore people who interact with animals such as farmers, hunters and herders are at risk, which means that the people they interact with are also at risk because the disease can be transmitted from person to person</p>
      <p>China was the first to impose the closure and subsequently managed to control the virus significantly, and China's strategy to deal with Covid-19 was in two distinct phases. Strict actions were taken</p>
      <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Including Chinese governments that extended holidays and banned intercity travel</li>
        <li>Use the closure period to build treatment capabilities, track and isolate all people who traveled from Wuhan and their contacts</li>
        <li>Preventing people from leaving their homes: In many parts of cities, this means that each family has one permit, which can be used by one person in the family, once in two days</li>
        <li>They imposed severe restrictions on movement between regions</li>
        <li>They checked the temperature and the insulation, and you had to check your temperature if you entered a store or office</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
      <p>The four pillars that China has made: quarantine, isolation, social spacing, and masks, using mobile applications to enforce the above.</p>
      <p>China-focused mainly on isolating the wounded or suspects from his family and people and asked everyone to wear masks to newborns.</p>
      <h3>So please if you are a Chinese citizen:</h3>
   <blockquote>
     <ul>
  <li>stay home as much as you can</li>
  <li>if going out is necessary wear a medical mask</li>
  <li>Avoid being in dense places in cities as they are known for widespread of the virus</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
