# track-the-infection
Human intervention and COVID-19 navigator
The project illustrates how man contributed in spreading of COVID-19 virus across different countries. 
It uses a simple, easy to deal with interface consisting of a globe that visualizes different clickable countries that gives more information when clicked about how the residents helped the virus spread and some safety precautions for current residents
In addition to a real time tracker of current cases, it's also combined with an accurate translator that allows translating to multiple languages so it could be suitable for people from all around the world to take care and stay safe.
