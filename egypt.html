     <p>the first case for Egyptian citizen was a 44-year old man  com from Serbia but the hotspot of the virus  was in Luxor when infected tourists visit Luxor during a Nile trip.</p>
     <p>The most corona virus cases are in Cairo because the population dense Cairo population is the most dense city in Egypt , Alexandria is in the second place in corona virus case which means that there is extreme increasing in cities. The government imposed quarantined and closed all schools,universities, mosques , churches , cinemas , gym and amusement parks. And open supermarkets or restaurants( delivery only).</p>
     <p>There are many activities that Egyptians  related to Egyptian culture but helps in corona virus spreading like outdoor markets. A lot of Egyptians buy their food from outdoor markets. So these places is always crowded which may be a factor for corona virus spreading.</p>
     <h3>So please if you are an Egyptian citizen:</h3>
   <blockquote>

  <li>Stay at home as much as possible</li>
  <li>if going out is necessary wear a medical mask</li>

  <li>Avoid being in dense places in cities as they are known for widespread of the virus</li>
    </ul>
